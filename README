FastCalc
========

Usage
-----

Use your mobile as a calculator!
Instead of other calculators, or the calculators that are usually
in the mobile phones, this calculator uses only the 12 keys on
your mobile device (the 10 number keys plus asterisk and hash).

This is supposed to make it slightly faster while typing, since
the fingures do not have to travel a long distance and the hand
does not need to move.

Since the operations needed are more than 12, a "trick" similar
to "sticky keys" is used. One key of the 12 (namely the hash) is
used as a "shift" key. When pressed instead of having any direct
result, the usage of the keyboard is changed. So now the usable
operations are 11 + 11 (normal & shifted).

In order for the user to be informed on the usage of each key, on
the botom of the screen the map of the keys is displayed, presenting
the usage of each key. If the status is "normal" then this map
is drawn in white. If it is shifted then it's black.


Compile
-------

The program is distributed already in binary (jar & jad) mode, ready
to be installed in any mobile device with new java implementation.

If you want to compile it, you will need at least WTK2.1. A preliminary
makefile is provided, but I don't know if this will work for you
(it works for me).
